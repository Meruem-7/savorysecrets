            <h2>Directions :</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°. On a lightly floured surface, roll half the dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle;
                    transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. Chill while preparing filling. In a small bowl, combine sugars, flour
                    and spices. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss to coat. Add
                    filling to crust; dot with butter.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. Cut
                    slits in top. Beat egg white until foamy; brush over crust. If desired, sprinkle with turbinado
                    sugar and ground cinnamon.</li>
                <li>Bake on the lowest rack 60-70 minutes, until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, covering
                    with foil halfway if crust begins to get too dark. Cool on a wire rack. If desired, serve with ice
                    cream and caramel sauce.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Apple Pie Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We prefer using Granny Smith apples for pies because of their tart flavor and ability to hold
                        their shape. If you want something with a little more sweetness, we recommend using Braeburn,
                        Golden Delicious or Jonagold.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Typically, 1 medium apple yields 1-1/3 cups sliced. For 6 cups of sliced apples, you will need
                        about 5 medium-sized peeled apples.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>To prevent your pie from getting watery, make sure to have your pie crust ready before mixing
                        the filling. The longer the filling sits before baking, the more moisture it will release.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>To avoid a pie bottom that's soggy, allow the bottom crust to heat more rapidly than the rest of
                        the pie. To do this, place a baking sheet in the oven while preheating and then bake your pie on
                        the sheet.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Dough for double-crust pie: <br>
                        Combine 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour and 1/2 tsp. salt; cut in 1 cup cold butter until crumbly.
                        Gradually add 1/3 to 2/3 cup ice water, tossing with a fork until dough holds together when
                        pressed. Divide dough in half. Shape each into a disk; wrap and refrigerate 1 hour.</li>
                </ul>
