            <h2>Directions :</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325°. Grease and flour two 9-in. round baking pans. Sift dry ingredients together
                    into a large bowl. Add oil, coffee and milk; mix at medium speed 1 minute. Add eggs and vanilla;
                    beat 2 minutes longer. (Batter will be thin.) Pour into prepared pans.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25-30 minutes. Cool in pans 10
                    minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Meanwhile, for icing, in a small saucepan, whisk flour and milk until smooth. Bring to a boil over
                    medium heat; cook and stir until thickened, 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl. Cover and
                    refrigerate until chilled.</li>
                <br>
                <li>In a large bowl, beat butter, shortening, sugar and vanilla until creamy, 3-4 minutes. Add chilled
                    milk mixture and beat 10 minutes. Stir in sprinkles if desired. Spread frosting between layers and
                    over top and sides of cake. If desired, dust with additional cocoa.</li>

                <h3>Moist Chocolate Cake Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can you make this chocolate cake ahead of time?<br>
                        You can assemble the entire cake 2 to 3 days ahead of time. Just layer and frost the cake and
                        store it in a cake carrier until you want to serve it. The cake can also be refrigerated, uncut
                        in a cake carrier, for a few days longer. Just be sure to let it come to room temperature before
                        serving for maximum flavor. If you are in a time crunch, this cake freezes beautifully too. Wrap
                        the unfrosted layers well, and keep in your freezer for up to 2 months.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Can you make this moist chocolate cake in different baking pans?<br>
                        You can bake this cake in two 8-in. round pans (with leftover batter in 6 additional muffin
                        cups), or even as three thin 8-in. layers. As these are smaller cake pans, keep an eye on time
                        as they bake and test accordingly with a toothpick; they may not need to bake as long.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>How should you store leftover moist chocolate cake?<br>
                        This chocolate cake tastes better, and dries out less, if kept at room temperature in a cake
                        carrier—not in the refrigerator. It can be stored for 3 to 4 days at its freshest. Press a piece
                        of waxed paper or plastic wrap against the cut pieces of the cake to prevent it from drying out.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Can you replace the oil in this moist chocolate cake recipe with melted butter?<br>
                        You can certainly replace the oil with melted butter in this cake recipe. Most of the time,
                        melted butter can substitute for oil in a 1:1 ratio. Simply melt your butter down and measure in
                        a liquid measuring cup to the equivalent of the oil in the recipe. Keep in mind that cakes
                        containing butter as a primary fat are a little drier than those made with oil. You will still
                        have a delicious cake, but it may not have as moist a crumb.
